# Convex Optimisation
This repository contains assignments for the course "Convex Optimisation" and the implementation of different related algorithms in Python/Jupyter Notebook.
## Assignment 1: Taylor Approximation & Unconstrained Optimisation
This assignment covers the topic of Taylor's Approximation and Unconstrained Optimisation. The goal of this assignment is to understand the method to solve taylor approximation and  an unconstrained optimisation problem and implement them in Python. The following methods are implemented:<br>
<br>
linear and quadratic approximation
Line Search Subroutine
Combinational Descent
## How to Run
The assignments are implemented in Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebooks, make sure you have Jupyter installed and then running in VSCode.
## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code in the notebooks:<br>
NumPy<br>
Matplotlib<br>
Numdifftools<br>
